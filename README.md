# Planned Implementation Direction

## ~~Step 1: Learn the process behind bindgen and writing build scripts~~

## ~~Step 2: Write the~~ interface between our now greatly minimized C code and Rust

## Step 3: Finish the last few details in terms of implementaion without fuser

## Step 4: Understand more about the fuser/Rust interface and implement the functions

## Step 5: Test.
